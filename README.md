## Overview

The models included in this repository simulate the effects of electrical stimulation on:
- **Thigh Muscle:** Focusing on analysing double derivative errors and their effects on a Hodgkin-Huxley axon model.
- **Cortical Region:** Focusing on analysing double derivative errors produced by material changes and Multiscaling meshes.
